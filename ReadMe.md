CPlusPlus

This project was used to create a frequency counter to allow for a company to visualize which products sold most in there store. I feel like the thing I did particularly well was how i planned and implemented the new things I was learning in zybooks while designing the project. I ended up finishing before I really got to the chapters on memory leaks so that is the area I could improve on and also using a linked list or max heap as an internal data structure would help organize the data and consume less memory. The two pieces of code that I found the most challenging was dealing with pointers. This project taught me alot about how class objects behave in C++ and what I need to consider when trying to implement high level data structures. I designed this program beforehand with sudocode and a flowchart to make sure that my logic followed a process and most of the functions were easy to use and understand.
